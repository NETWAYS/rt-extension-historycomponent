NAME
    RT-Extension-HistoryComponent - Provides a portlet to list recently viewed tickets

DESCRIPTION
    RT already got a way to see recently viewed tickets. However, it's buried underneath three main menu levels
    and easy to miss.

    This extension provides a simple portlet that looks no other than any other ticket-list portlet. But it moves
    the ticket listing from the mentioned main menu to a more visible and accessible location on "RT at a glance".

    No configuration required.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4.2
